# Data Science sample Apps with Streamlit

Those apps were maded following the instructions from [Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM)

There are changes from the original codes because the packages were updated and the modules and methods are slightly different.

You can check all the apps and install the *requirements.txt* file with the dependencies for all apps.
